													<p>Hyderabad: If we take the flow of new investments as the sign of recovery in the Hyderabad real estate market, the City of Pearls lags behind by miles. For, the new investments into the city had fallen by a significant 35 per cent during 12 months to June 2017, according to a recent global report by Cushman & Wakefield, a global real estate services company.
													The report estimated that Hyderabad received a total of $30 million (`193 crore) in property investments in 12 months from July 2016 to June 2017. It was 35 per cent less than what the city got in preceding year i.e. July 2015 to June 2016. However, the city has Chennai for company because the Tamil Nadu’s capital saw much higher fall of 57 per cent in the real estate investments to $118 million (Rs 762 crore) in the same period. It however did not spell out the reasons for the decline in investments in Hyderabad and Chennai.  
													But other Indian cities figured in the worldwide report fared extremely well during the same period. Mumbai, the country’s commercial capital, saw 195 per cent jump in realty investment to $1,749 million (nearly Rs 11,295 crore) while Bengaluru registered 54 per cent upswing to $461 million (Rs 2,977 crore). New Delhi received $181 million (Rs 1,170 crore), recording a growth of 45 per cent.

														<p>Mumbai: Market rates of residential properties in Colaba, Dadar, Santacruz, Vile Parle dip below ready reckoner rates as lakhs of houses remain unsold.
															The realty sector in Mumbai is witnessing its worst slump ever, with market rates of properties in several areas, including south Mumbai, dipping below the ready reckoner rates.
															Prominent developers and industry watchers told Mumbai Mirror that never in the history of the city have they witnessed such a phenomenon, even as debt-laden builders, struggling with slow sales, unsold apartments, and delayed/stalled projects, are pulling out all stops to attract buyers.
															The real estate agents this newspaper spoke to said the market rates of residential properties in Colaba (Shahid Bhagat Singh Road) is around Rs 40,000 per sq ft, while the ready reckoner rates for the same properties is at least Rs 10,000 more. Similarly, the market rates of residential properties in Dadar West is around 30,000 per sq ft, whereas the ready reckoner rates in the area are pegged at Rs 40,000 to Rs 45,000 per sq ft. In parts of Powai, the current ready reckoner rate is Rs 27,000 per sq ft while flats are being offered for Rs 25,000 per sq ft or less.

															NEW DELHI:  The Delhi High Court today grilled a man for targeting a particular property in the name of alleged illegal construction, saying it will take action against frivolous Public Interest Litigations or PILs.
															The court questioned the petitioner, who claimed to be a social activist and who was not personally present at the hearing, and his counsel over how many petitions they have filed in public interest. However, it did not get any response from the counsel.
															The court's observation came when a woman, against whose house the petitioner has sought action, urged the court's intervention alleging that she was being harassed by the petitioner and two advocates.
															"We will take action and send it to the bar council if the process of public interest litigation (PIL) is abused and if frivolous PILs are filed," a bench of Acting Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar said.
															It questioned the petitioner's counsel for targeting a property in Lajpat Nagar in South Delhi even though he resides near East Delhi's Laxmi Nagar where there are huge illegal constructions.

															Bangalore:
															As the year inches towards closure, property developers in Bangalore ngaluru have slowly started advertising new launches after lying dormant throughout as demonetisation, implementation of RERA and subsequent uncertainties turned their pipeline bone dry.
															Shriram, Sobha and Puravankara among others have made big announcements in the last two months after having obtained their RERA registration numbers for their projects. While this does not signal an imminent recovery, it does show signs of return to normalcy to some extent.
															Rampant launches had all but dried up as builders took time to understand the implications of RERA which was introduced to bring some level of transparency and accountability in the realty sector. This also made realtors go back to the drawing board and re-calibrate their yet to be launched projects to comply with the rules or run the risk of getting rejected by the authority.
															"In 2017, developers restricted new launches and focused on completing projects. This trend will continue in 2018 as well, as the regulatory pressure will further increase. Also, the supply of readyto-move-in properties might increase in 2018 because of developers' sustained focus on completing their existing projects," Anuj Puri, Chairman of Anarock Property Consultants said.

															Amaravati: Real estate in the capital city area has been witnessing a downturn, contrary to expectations of a boom. The fact that buyers are staying away from the Amaravati region is a major cause of concern for both the farmers who own plots and realtors.
															Land rates which soared in the past 12 months came crashing down following the low demand. The delay in finalisation of the land pooling scheme layouts is one factor behind this slump. The government's failure to translate at least some of its promises into reality is another.
															According to sources, realtors went on a land buying spree in the area soon after the capital city announcement but most are now trying to off-load their investments. One of them purchased about 360 acres in bits and pieces in CRDA villages. At present, he is busy scouting for buyers. The realtor, who initially picked up land at Rs 30 lakh per acre about a year ago, went on to spend as much as Rs 1.2 crore on acre of land. His average spending was around Rs 70-Rs 80 lakh per acre. His dreams of striking it rich have crumbled as the realty bubble has burst. Now he is hard pressed to sell the land at Rs 1.4 crore to Rs 1.5 crore an acre so that he could repay the money he borrowed from friends and relatives.

											<p>Amaravati: Real estate in the capital city area has been witnessing a downturn, contrary to expectations of a boom. The fact that buyers are staying away from the Amaravati region is a major cause of concern for both the farmers who own plots and realtors.
											Land rates which soared in the past 12 months came crashing down following the low demand. The delay in finalisation of the land pooling scheme layouts is one factor behind this slump. The government's failure to translate at least some of its promises into reality is another.
											According to sources, realtors went on a land buying spree in the area soon after the capital city announcement but most are now trying to off-load their investments. One of them purchased about 360 acres in bits and pieces in CRDA villages. At present, he is busy scouting for buyers. The realtor, who initially picked up land at Rs 30 lakh per acre about a year ago, went on to spend as much as Rs 1.2 crore on acre of land. His average spending was around Rs 70-Rs 80 lakh per acre. His dreams of striking it rich have crumbled as the realty bubble has burst. Now he is hard pressed to sell the land at Rs 1.4 crore to Rs 1.5 crore an acre so that he could repay the money he borrowed from friends and relatives.
